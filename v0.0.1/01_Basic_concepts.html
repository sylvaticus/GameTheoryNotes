Each player can have different actions available (including in different number). The total possible states of the world correspond to all the possible actions that all the <span>$N$</span> players can take and it is given by the <em>N</em>-dimensional tensor <span>$A$</span> of size <span>$(length(A_1),length(A_2),...,length(A_n)$</span>.

This is a <span>$N+1$</span> dimensional tensor of size <span>$(length(A_1),length(A_2),...,length(A_n),N$</span>. The last dimension has size <span>$N$</span>, as each player has its own utility functions of the various states of the world.

Strategies <span>$s_{ni}$</span> with a single action with non-zero probabilities are called <strong>pure strategies</strong>, while strategies with more than one available action assigned non-zero probabilities are called <strong>mixed strategies</strong> and strategies with non zero probabilities for all actions are named <strong>fully mixed straegies</strong>. The (sub)set of actions assigned non-zero probabilities is called <strong>support</strong> of the given strategy.

The action <code>B</code> then <em>dominates</em> the other one for both the players even if they could coordinate they would be both better off by both choosing <code>A</code>.
