# GameTheoryNotes
Student's note on Game Theory, mainly from the Stanford University and The University of British Columbia" Coursera [Game Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1)" (_Jackson, Leyton-Brown & Shoham_) MOOC 


These student's notes use [Julia](https://julialang.org) snippets to make more concrete or verify the theoretical concepts.
"Polished" implementation of these snippets are in the companion repository [`StrategicGames`](https://github.com/sylvaticus/StrategicGames.jl), a Julia package to analyse strategic games using Game Theory.

_Disclaimer: The following notes are a mesh of my own notes, selected transcripts, some useful forum threads and various course material. I do not claim any authorship of these notes, but at the same time any error could well be arising from my own interpretation of the material._

**Contributions are really welcome**.
